Autonomous Fire-Detecting Robot
Authors: M. Jessup, S. Raje, S. Shahri, J. Zhang

This project contains the Arduino (and header) files for our fire detecting, and obstacle avoiding mobile, autonmous robot.

The Navigate Perimeter files enable the robot to navigate the outskirts of the perimeter of a table (with walls). Using placed sensors, and PID controls the robot navigates without deviating its angle of attack of less than 5 degrees.

The Fire Detect and Obstacle Avoid files further enhance the robots autonomous ability to detect a fire (lamp) located randomly on the table, and then approach the fire and avoid any obstacles within its path. This section used both PID and Fuzzy logic control to enable the successful delivery of the task.
